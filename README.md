# Project Portfolio
This repository demonstrates applications of data processing and machine learning. Projects include engineering datasets with S&P 500 constituents and applying psychology-based tendencies from *Poor Charlie's Almanack* to real-world business data. Each notebook combines technical implementation with visualization and analysis to illustrate both methods and insights.

## Psychology of Human Misjudgment
File: `psychological_tendencies.ipynb`

This notebook demonstrates methods of data processing and machine learning while applying psychology-based tendencies from *Poor Charlie's Almanack.*
- **Reward and punishment superresponse tendency**: Illustrated using insurance data comparing National Indemnity vs. industry averages. KMeans clustering is applied to premium volume changes and underwriting profits, showing how employee incentive structures led to distinct outcomes.
- **Doubt-avoidance tendency**: Illustrated with credit card industry data (American Express, Visa, Mastercard). Linear regression examines relationships between cards-in-force, transaction volume, and pretax income, revealing flaws in common assumptions.

## Financial Data Processing and Analytics
Files:
- `data_preprocessing_analytics_part1.ipynb`
- `data_preprocessing_analytics_part2.ipynb`

These notebooks demonstrate methods of financial data retrieval, preprocessing, and analytics using S&P 500 constituent data. 
- Automated retrieval, preprocessing, and visualization of company fundamentals
- Construction of datasets with 100+ features for cross-sectional and time-series analysis
- Illustration of a simple investment checklist (e.g., cash > long-term debt, growth > 15%, PE < 50) and its effect on portfolio performance
